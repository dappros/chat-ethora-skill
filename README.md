# ethora-skill

A [Claude Code skill](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that integrates Ethora chat (`@ethora/chat-component` for React, `@ethora/chat-component-rn` for React Native) into an existing app or a brand-new one: dependency install, `XmppProvider` wrapping, page/screen creation, terminal sign-in to the Ethora admin to create/select an app and pull credentials, the client-JWT "users logged in automatically" flow, self-hosted servers, and a verification script.

## Install

**Option A — plugin marketplace (recommended, one command, easy updates).** In Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add dappros/chat-ethora-skill
/plugin install ethora-skill@ethora
```
Shell equivalent: `claude plugin marketplace add dappros/chat-ethora-skill && claude plugin install ethora-skill@ethora`.
Update later with `/plugin marketplace update ethora`.

**Option B — clone into a project (team repo, pinned version):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dappros/chat-ethora-skill .claude/skills/ethora-skill
```
or personal, for all projects: `git clone https://github.com/dappros/chat-ethora-skill ~/.claude/skills/ethora-skill`.

**Option C — `.skill` archive** from the GitHub Releases page: unzip into `.claude/skills/`.

Then just ask Claude Code: *"add Ethora chat to this app"* — or invoke `/ethora-skill`.

## Does it change my backend?

Only if you agree. "Users land in the chat already signed in" needs one server route (`GET /api/ethora/token`) that signs a short-lived token with the Ethora app secret, and that secret can never live in a browser or mobile app. The skill asks first, then:

- **you own the backend** → it adds the route behind your existing auth, in your backend's language (Node templates included; Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, Java/Kotlin, .NET written from the same contract);
- **the backend is someone else's** → it leaves it alone, writes `ETHORA_BACKEND.md` (the contract + reference code) for the backend team, and uses a temporary dev token so you can work now;
- **there is no backend** → it uses Ethora's own login inside the chat (separate chat accounts) or a dev-only token.

## Which server can I use?

Ethora Cloud (default) or your own **self-hosted Ethora** server. A custom API only works if it is an Ethora deployment, i.e. exposes the same endpoints as `https://api.chat.ethora.com/api-docs/` and an Ethora-compatible XMPP server. Your own unrelated backend or another chat vendor will not work as the chat server.

## Privacy, credentials and network

- **Your Ethora password and MFA code** are typed only by you, at a hidden prompt of `scripts/ethora-admin.mjs` in your own terminal. They are never read from environment variables or files, never stored, and never pass through Claude.
- **What is stored locally:** `~/.ethora/session.json` (your Ethora admin session for the terminal tools; `node scripts/ethora-admin.mjs logout` deletes it) and `~/.ethora/profiles.json` (the selected app: id, app token, app secret, endpoints; same file as `npx @ethora/setup`). Both are on your machine only. `write-env.mjs` copies public values into your project's env files and the app secret only into server-side env files, and adds them to `.gitignore`.
- **Network:** the scripts talk only to the Ethora API you chose (default `https://api.chat.ethora.com`, or your self-hosted origin) and, in `verify-setup.mjs`, check that its XMPP host answers. No telemetry, nothing else is contacted.

## React Native notes

The RN SDK has native modules, so it **does not run in Expo Go**: use a development build (`npx expo run:ios|android`). The skill installs the native peers with `expo install` before the SDK (a plain `npm install` hits peer conflicts on fresh Expo apps) and starts Metro with a cleared cache.

Scripts need Node ≥ 18 and no dependencies. Profiles are stored in `~/.ethora/profiles.json`, the same file `npx @ethora/setup` uses.

## Manual use of the scripts

```bash
node scripts/ethora-admin.mjs setup                     # Cloud: account → app → profile
node scripts/ethora-admin.mjs setup --api https://api.chat.acme.com   # self-hosted
node scripts/write-env.mjs --target vite --dir .        # or next | cra | expo | rn | backend
node scripts/verify-setup.mjs --user-id dev-user-1 --email dev@example.com
```
